![Alt text](pics/demo2.png?raw=true "Sample")

Requirements for compiling:  
qmake
g++
qt libararies

this gui is based on this work:  
https://github.com/georgewhewell/undervolt  
make sure "undervolt" command works




Run Binaries x64:  
this does not need requirements:

git clone https://github.com/andrewasd/undervolt-gui.git  
cd undervolt-gui  
chmod +x bin/undervolt  
sudo bin/undervolt  




Compile:  
git clone https://github.com/andrewasd/undervolt-gui.git  
cd undervolt-gui  
chmod +x install.sh  
sudo ./install.sh

Run:  
sudo ./run.sh

The program works but is still buggy, at the beginning it wil ask for the sudo password, but 
if you dont enter the correct password it may crash the pc.
